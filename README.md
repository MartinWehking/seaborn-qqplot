## Quickstart

The extension wants to be as similar as seaborn as possible.

```python
from seaborn_qqplot import pplot
```

The example provided with the package is the Iris dataset:

```python
import seaborn as sns

iris_data = sns.load_dataset('iris')
```

## Future Development

The release is not stable yet. It still need some work, help is welcome.

## Requirements

These requirements reflect the testing environment.  It is possible
that seaborn-qqplot will work with older versions.

* Python (3.6,3.7,3.8)
* NumPy (1.16+)
* SciPy (1.2+)
* Pandas (0.23+)

The library was not tested on python 3.9 yet, so there is not guarantee that it will be possible to use with this python version.
